# Algorithm:
1. Setup your x-values
Purpose: Define the domain of the function where the expression under the square root √(3 − x²) is real.
Why: The domain is limited to " " because beyond that, the square root becomes imaginary.
How:
Create x_right for positive side of x
Create x_left for negative side by reversing -x_right
Concatenate both to get full x_full
2. Prepare the plot
Purpose: Set up the visual environment.
Steps:
Create a figure and axis using plt.subplots()
Set up x and y limits
Draw a grid and axes
Add an empty line plot (line, = ax.plot(...)) for animation
Add title, aspect ratio, etc.
3. Define the initial function
Purpose: Provide a clean slate before animation starts.
How:
def init():
    line.set_data([], [])
    return line,
4. Define the animation function
Purpose: This is where magic happens for each frame.
What it does:
Takes in a value of k (changes from 0 to 100 over time)
Calculates y_right using the function's equation on the positive x
Calculates y_left for negative x
Concatenates both y_left and y_right into y_full
Updates the line data
5. Create the animation
Purpose: Animate the function by varying k.
How:
Use FuncAnimation from matplotlib.animation
Set frames=np.linspace(0, 100, 200) so k goes smoothly from 0 to 100
Call animate(k) for each frame
Use interval=50 to control speed
6. Show the animation: plt.show()
